# Active Self-Stabilising Arm

## Summary

Being British, carrying mugs of tea is a daily occurance. It's absolutely mission-critical to deliver the beverage to the recipient without a drop spilled. Instead of putting less tea in the mugs, I'm going to build a three-axis gimbal to keep mugs level while in transit.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
